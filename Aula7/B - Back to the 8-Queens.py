# According to Wikipedia, the 8 queens puzzle is the problem of placing eight chess queens on an 8Ã—8 chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. Thus, a solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.
# But we can brute force it because we have only 92 cases to check.

                yield from queens(n, i + 1, a + [j], b + [i + j], c + [i - j]) # Very cool use of yield in Python, it's like a return but it doesn't stop the function
